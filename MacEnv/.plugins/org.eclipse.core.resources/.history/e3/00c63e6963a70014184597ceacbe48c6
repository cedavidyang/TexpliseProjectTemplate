\section{Overview of complete work}
In this week, deterioration of bonding and FRP strength due to moisture intake
has been modelled based on the existing prediction models. For bonding
deterioration, \citeapos{ouyang2009analytical} model has been used to relate
fracture energy degradation with the moisture attack in terms of interface
region relative humidity (IRRH). For FRP strength deterioration, moisture intake
has been analyzed in order to use prediction models
\citep{phani1986hydrothermal, phani1987temperature} obtained from accelerated
tests in real-world structures. FRP and bonding deterioration due to moisture
attack have been analyzed for the shear strengthening schemes at year 78 because
of their large proportion of FRP contribution to the overall shear capacity.
From the analysis, it can be concluded that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Nearly all the prediction models are based on accelerated tests. The
  relation to natural exposure should be considered;
  \item Opinions on FRP and bonding durability is still very divided;
  \item Compared with steel corrosion, FRP and bonding deterioration under
  natural exposure have only a marginal effect on the reliability of the
  strengthened girder.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research results and interpretations}

\subsection{FRP deterioration}
Moisture has a detrimental effect on the properties of bonding materials in FRP
(e.g. epoxy). Therefore, the strength deterioration of FRP composites depends
very much on the epoxy degradation. As a result, experimental results in the
literature often reveal large scattered or even total opposite trends
\citep{karbhari2007design, shrestha2015durability, sen2015developments}. In the
present study, the prediction model proposed by \citet{phani1986hydrothermal,
phani1987temperature} and reviewed by \citet{karbhari2007design} and
\citet{davalos2012long} is used to consider the strength deterioration of CFRP
materials.


Since the model is proposed based on the results in accelerated tests, moisture
intake of CFRP is used to relate the prediction results to scenarios of natural
exposure. Diffusion coefficient and saturated moisture content of CFRP are based
on \citet{ouyang2008modeling}. Environmental relative humidity is assumed
to be 75\%. Results of strength deterioration during 50 years of service are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:frp_degradation}.

\subsection{Bonding deterioration}
Similar to FRP deterioration, bonding deterioration due to moisture can also be
very scattered because of the different epoxy materials used. In addition, the
strengthening durability is also effected by other factors such as surface
treatment. In the present study, bonding deterioration is determined by the
empirical formula proposed by \citet{ouyang2009analytical}
(Eq.~\ref{eq:bond_degrade}), in which the fracture energy of bonding is related
to interface region relative humidity (IRRH).
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bond_degrade}
{{G}_{f}}\left( H \right)={{G}_{f0}}\left( 1-\frac{1-\beta }{1+{{\left\{
\left[ 1-H\left( x,y,t \right) \right]/\left( 1-{{H}_{d}} \right)
\right\}}^{n}}} \right)
\end{equation}


In order to obtain the IRRH at the bonding interface, finite element method for
Fourier heat transfer is used due to its analogy to diffusion problems
\citep{ouyang2008modeling}. Parameters used in the analysis can be found in
\citet{ouyang2008modeling}. The epoxy thickness is assumed to be \unit[1]{mm}
\citep{tuakta2011deterioration}, and the three layers of wet lay-up fabric sheet
are assumed to be \unit[2]{mm} in total. Girder dimension can be found in the
previous report. IRRH distribution at year 50 is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:IRRH_distribution}. Development of IRRH at bond interface is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:IRRH_development}. The corresponding fracture energy
can be determined by virtue of Eq.~\ref{eq:bond_degrade} and is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:Gf_development}. According to \citet{ouyang2009analytical},
debonding strength is proportional to the square root of the ratio of
the average fracture energy after exposure to the original fracture energy, as
shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:Gf_degrade}. Figure~\ref{fig:bond_degrade} illustrates the
deterioration of debonding strength.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Gf_degrade}
\frac{\sigma_{deb} \left(t\right)}{\sigma} =
\frac{\bar{G}_f\left(t\right)}{G_{f0}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Time-variant reliability considering FRP and bonding deterioration}
Time-variant reliability of the strengthened RC girder is analyzed using the
approach in the previous reports. FRP and bonding deterioration are incorporated
into the analysis. Figure~\ref{} presents the analysis results along with the
time-variant reliability without considering the deterioration. From
Figure~\ref{}, it can be seen that FRP and bonding deterioration only have a
marginal effect on the reliability compared with steel corrosion. The
strengthened girder can last more than 50 years even considering the
deterioration. The analysis demonstrates the superb durability and
life-cycle advantage of FRP strengthening.
